## Academics

I am majoring in Psychology with a minor in English. I am currently enrolled in **ENGL396: Software Documentation**. When I graduate, 
I plan to become Cognitive Developmental Psychology researcher.

Here is a list of my favorite classes at UW:

## Words of Wisdom

One of my favorite quotes is from Albert Einstein:

> "The only thing that you absolutely have to know, is the location of the library."
